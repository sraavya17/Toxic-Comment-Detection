# Toxic-Comment-Detection
This project aims to detect the toxic comments using machine learning models.
The model must differentiate between toxic comments and non-toxic comments.

# Algorithms
used Linear Regression and naive bayes

# Files
dataset file is used for loading the dataset and preprocessing it.
Training file is used for training the models and evaluating it.
